                            <td>Deliverables are determined by sprints, or set periods of time in which a set of work must be completed and ready for review. </td>

                            <td>Measures production using velocity through sprints. Each sprint is laid out back-to-back and/or concurrently so that each additional sprint relies on the success of the one before it. </td>

                            <td>Products and processes are delivered continuously on an as-needed basis (with due dates determined by the business as needed).</td>
                            <td>Uses a “pull system,” or a systematic workflow that allows team members to only “pull” new tasks once the previous task is complete. </td>
                            <td>Allows for changes to be made to a project mid-stream, allowing for iterations and continuous improvement prior to the completion of a project. </td>
                            <td>Measures production using “cycle time,” or the amount of time it takes to complete one full piece of a project from beginning to end. </td>
                            <td>Best for projects with widely-varying priorities. </td>
